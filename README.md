# A Walk on the Hyperthreaded Side: 
# an Implementation and Analysis of Translating Virtual Addresses on a GPU
This work is Columbia University Spring 2017, COMS 4824 Computer Architecture final project. We implement a simulation for a GPU running a page walk using CUDA and benchmark it against a CPU.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your AWS EC2 NVIDIA GPU for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
